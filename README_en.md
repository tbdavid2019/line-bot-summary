# LINE-NEWS-Bot_en

An AI-driven LINE chatbot providing different news perspectives: AI, what's your take?

## Introduction

Have you ever read a news article and felt that something about the report was a bit off, but couldn't quite put your finger on it?

If you're interested in hearing alternative viewpoints, this LINE chatbot is more than happy to offer its insights üéôÔ∏è. 

Simply share a news link with it, and it will provide comments based on the article's headline, perspectives, and presentation, offering them as a reference for you.

Of course, it's important not to fully accept its opinions, as AI can easily make mistakes, and its comments might not always be impartial üòÖ. This isn't professional news critique; the AI's viewpoints are merely for consideration, so please don't take them too seriously‚ö†Ô∏è.

Additionally, because the bot is powered by the same GPT-3.5 as ChatGPT üß†, feel free to have casual conversations with it or ask questions beyond news!
